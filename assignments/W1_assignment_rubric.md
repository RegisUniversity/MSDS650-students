# EDA - stats and graphs

## Goals
This assignment will help you learn some of the techniques commonly used in exploratory data analysis.
Part of EDA is finding interesting questions to ask, and answering them with summary statistics and/or plots.

## How to submit the assignment
You can do the assignment in Python or R.  The assignment can be done within a jupyter notebook, or submitted as a text document writeup (e.g. in Word, Google docs, etc, with summary stats and graphics) along with code you used to create the plots and statistics.  If using a Jupyter notebook, you can change some of the cells from 'code' to 'markdown' to add discussion.  Here's a cheatsheet for [markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet), it's pretty easy to learn.

Another option is to use [rpubs](http://rpubs.com/), and submit the link.  You could also create [a PDF report with R](https://medium.com/@sorenlind/create-pdf-reports-using-r-r-markdown-latex-and-knitr-on-windows-10-952b0c48bfa9#.ymx9abvnp).  

You could post the assignment on Github, and send me the link.  Github will naturally display jupyter notebooks and markdown within web browsers.

## Other notes
The written part of the assignment should not be very long, at most a few paragraphs for each of the criteria listed below.

Please also link to your data source you used for the assignment in your writeup/notebook.

Criteria | Specifications | Percent of assignment grade
:-----|:-----|:-----
Summary Stats | At least one of each of the following summary statistics has been shown, and have been discussed in writing:<br><br>mean<br>median<br>max<br>min<br>standard deviation<br><br>These summary stats should be from data that has been grouped (for example, grouped by loan grade for lendingclub data).| 50
Plotting | At least one of each type of plot has been made:<br><br>histogram<br>bar<br>boxplot<br>scatter plot<br><br>and at least one of the plots has been discussed in writing. | 50
Bonus Statistics | Higher order summary statistics are calculated and discussed:  skewness, kurtosis, L-moments, quartiles, correlation coefficients (Pearson, Spearman, etc) | 5% extra credit
Bonus Plots | One or more of these plots is shown and discussed: treeplots, violin plots, heatmaps, 3d plots, geographic maps | 5% extra credit
