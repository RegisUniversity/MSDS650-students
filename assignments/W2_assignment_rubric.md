# r-tutor ANOVA and DOE tutorials

## Goals
This assignment is intended to teach you about design of experiment (DOE) techniques, and the ANOVA technique.

## How to submit the assignment
You can do the assignment in Python or R.  The assignment can be done within a jupyter notebook, or submitted as a text document writeup (e.g. in Word, Google docs, etc, with summary stats and graphics) along with code you used to create the plots and statistics.  If using a Jupyter notebook, you can change some of the cells from 'code' to 'markdown' to add discussion.  Here's a cheatsheet for [markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet), it's pretty easy to learn.

Another option is to use [rpubs](http://rpubs.com/), and submit the link.  You could also create a [PDF report with R](https://medium.com/@sorenlind/create-pdf-reports-using-r-r-markdown-latex-and-knitr-on-windows-10-952b0c48bfa9#.ymx9abvnp).  

You could post the assignment on Github, and send me the link.  Github will naturally display jupyter notebooks and markdown within web browsers.

## Other notes
The written part of the assignment should not be very long, at most a few paragraphs for each of the criteria.

Criteria | Specifications | Percent of assignment grade
:-----|:-----|:-----
Questions | Answer these questions:<br><br>1.What does an Analysis of Variance tell you? What types of questions does it answer?<br><br>2.What then is the significance of experimental design? | 20
Tutorial |Take a look at the R Tutorial site at http://www.r-tutor.com/category/statistical-concept/anova<br>Run the 3 tutorials in R or Python- *factorial design*, *randomized block design*, and *completely randomized design*.<br><br>Also go through the one-way and two-way Analysis of Variance exercises: http://www.r-bloggers.com/one-way-analysis-of-variance-anova/ and http://www.r-bloggers.com/two-way-analysis-of-variance-anova/<br><br>Pick one of the above tutorials you worked through and submit your code and a small writeup on the results.  This can be a jupyter notebook or Word/Google Doc/other document, on rpubs, or a PDF. | 80
