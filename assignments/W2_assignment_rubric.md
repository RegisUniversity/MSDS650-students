# r-tutor ANOVA and DOE tutorials

This assignment is intended to teach you about design of experiments (DOE) techniques, and the ANOVA technique.  The assignment can be submitted as a jupyter notebook (preferred), or submitted as a text document writeup (e.g. in Word, Google docs, etc, with summary stats and graphics) along with code you used to create the plots and statistics.

You can also post the assignment on Github, and send me the link.  Github will naturally display jupyter notebooks and markdown within web browsers.

The written part of the assignment should not be very long, at most a few paragraphs for each of the criteria.
