# Hypothesis testing

## Goals
This assignment will allow you to practice executing a t-test on some sample data.

## How to submit the assignment
You can do the assignment in Python or R.  The assignment can be done within a jupyter notebook, or submitted as a text document writeup (e.g. in Word, Google docs, etc, with summary stats and graphics) along with code you used to create the plots and statistics.  If using a Jupyter notebook, you can change some of the cells from 'code' to 'markdown' to add discussion.  Here's a cheatsheet for [markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet), it's pretty easy to learn.  You can also save the notebook as html or PDF (will require installation of [pandoc](http://pandoc.org/installing.html)).

Another option is to use [rpubs](http://rpubs.com/), and submit the link.  You could also create a [PDF report with R](https://medium.com/@sorenlind/create-pdf-reports-using-r-r-markdown-latex-and-knitr-on-windows-10-952b0c48bfa9#.ymx9abvnp), or an html file.

You could post the assignment on Github, and send me the link.  Github will naturally display jupyter notebooks and markdown within web browsers.

## Other notes
The written part of the assignment should not be very long, at most a few paragraphs for each of the criteria.

Criteria | Specifications | Percent of assignment grade
:-----|:-----|:-----
t-test | The t-test was performed correctly on the data from 'paired t-test_3.xlsx'. | 60
Analysis | The results of the t-test were correctly interpreted (primarily statistical significance).  | 40
Bonus Analysis | The required number of samples to reach 95% power is correctly calculated, and the Type I and Type II errors rates are correctly discussed. | 5% bonus
