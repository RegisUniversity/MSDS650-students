# EDA introduction

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is usually the first step in any project involving data analytics or data science.  We are checking out the data, simply seeing what it looks like and deducing some basic facts about it.

For some examples of EDA, you can browse competitions at [kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions?sortBy=deadline&group=all&page=1&segment=allCategories).  The [kernels](https://www.kaggle.com/kernels?sortBy=votes) for the competitions (especially the competitions with prize money) tend to have at least one EDA example in R and one in Python.  Here are a few from the [Grupo Bimbo competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/grupo-bimbo-inventory-demand): [Python](https://www.kaggle.com/anokas/grupo-bimbo-inventory-demand/exploratory-data-analysis), [R](https://www.kaggle.com/fabienvs/grupo-bimbo-inventory-demand/grupo-bimbo-data-analysis), [another R](https://www.kaggle.com/vykhand/grupo-bimbo-inventory-demand/exploring-products).  Looking at these and other kernels, and trying to modify them to answer a new question (ideally a question you came up with out of curiousity) is a good way to learn how to do EDA.

John Tukey is one of the pioneers of [EDA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_data_analysis), and write a huge book on it called [Exploratory Data Analysis](https://www.amazon.com/Exploratory-Data-Analysis-John-Tukey/dp/0201076160).  He invented a common EDA technique, the box plot, in 1969.  To learn more about box plots, check [this out](http://www.physics.csbsju.edu/stats/box2.html).  Wikipedia also has a large list of some [EDA methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_data_analysis#Techniques).

Both R and Python have a large number of tools that are useful for EDA, which I won't even begin to list due to lack of time.  An interesting one I came across in R is [EDA-plot](https://artax.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/r-help/library/StatDA/html/edaplot.html) which can simultaneously plot a few EDA graphics at once.
